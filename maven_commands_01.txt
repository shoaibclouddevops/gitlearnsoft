Maven Lifecycle

The default Maven lifecycle consists of 8 major steps or phases for compiling, testing, building and installing a given Java project as specified below:

Validate: 
This step validates if the project structure is correct. For example â€“ It checks if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are available in the local repository.

Compile: 
It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class and stores the classes in target/classes folder.

Test: 
It runs unit tests for the project.

Package: 
This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.

Integration test: 
It runs the integration tests for the project.

Verify: 
This step runs checks to verify that the project is valid and meets the quality standards.

Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.

Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers.
